# CoE 113 Laboratory Checker

## Currently functional automated checkers

1. Machine Exercise 4 - Single Cycle MIPS Processor
   - Go to this [link][me4-checker] for the online ME4 checker.
   - Upload a **zip file** containing your RTL files only.
   - The name for the zip file should be **rtl.zip**.
   - The zip file should contain **one directory** named **rtl** which should contain all of your RTL files
   - Inside that **rtl** directory, there should be a verilog file named **single_cycle_mips.v**

2. Machine Exercise 5 - Pipelined MIPS Processor
   - Go to this [link][me5-checker] for the online ME4 checker.
   - Upload a **zip file** containing your RTL files only.
   - The name for the zip file should be **rtl.zip**.
   - The zip file should contain **one directory** named **rtl** which should contain all of your RTL files
   - Inside that **rtl** directory, there should be a verilog file named **pipelined_mips.v**
